# Task 5: Network Traffic Capture and Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates capturing and analyzing network traffic using **Wireshark**.  
The goal is to identify common protocols and understand basic traffic patterns.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Wireshark** (free, open-source network protocol analyzer)

## 📂 Steps Performed
1. Installed Wireshark on the system.
2. Started packet capture on the active network interface.
3. Generated network activity by browsing websites and pinging a test server.
4. Stopped the capture after approximately 1 minute.
5. Filtered captured packets by protocol (HTTP, DNS, TCP).
6. Identified at least 3 distinct network protocols.
7. Exported the capture as a `.pcap` file.
8. Summarized the findings in a short report.

## 📁 Deliverables
| File Name                     | Description                                   |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `network_capture_task5.pcap`   | Captured network packets                     |
| `network_traffic_analysis_report.pdf`         | Summary of task and protocols identified             |

## ⚠ Disclaimer
- Local/private IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x`) may appear in the `.pcap` file, but these are not publicly routable and pose no security risk.
- Public IPs in the file are limited to safe test addresses.
